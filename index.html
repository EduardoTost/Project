<p> Children have to go everywhere. From school, to soccer practice, to buying an ice-cream, and to dancing classes. Let it be the mother or father, someone of trust is needed to take this children safely to their activites. It is very common that neither the father or mother have the time to drive the kids around the city, and hiring a chofer is just to unsafe. Parents already have to deal with traffic and other time'consuming activites, and in this times, driving the kids around is just not viable anymore.</p>

<p>In the past, it was common to send children in the school bus or through public transportation. Parents could rely on the safety of the streets for their children to arrive safely to school or their other activites. With the current problem of insecurity in Mexico, sending off your children to school by hiself is just not safe anymore. There has to be a trustworthy adult accompanying the kid to his destination. This takes time from that adult in his way with the children and when he picks him up..</p>

<p>Example #1: John has to go to school every weekday at 7am. Both his parents go to work at 8am, and they must risk getting late in order to take their kid to school. One day on their way to school, there is a car accident and they make 30 more minutes to get to school. That day, the father arrives 30 minutes late to work. </p>
<p>Example #2: Freddy has soccer practice two days a week from 4pm to 6pm. His mother takes him to practice, but has to stay somewhere near the soccer practice, as she does not have enough time to go back home and then come back to pick up Freddy. Therefore, Freddy's mother wastes 2 hours per day twice a week.</p>
