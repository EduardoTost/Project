<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem.</h3>

<p> Children have to go everywhere. From school, to soccer practice, to buying an ice-cream, and to dancing classes. Let it be the mother or father, someone of trust is needed to take this children safely to their activites. It is very common that neither the father or mother have the time to drive the kids around the city, and hiring a chofer is just to unsafe. Parents already have to deal with traffic and other time'consuming activites, and in this times, driving the kids around is just not viable anymore.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>What? - Driving children. </p>
<p>Who? - The parents.</p>
<p>Where? - Any city in Mexico.</p>
<p>When? - Every weekday.</p>
<p>Why? - Time consuming.</p>
<p>How? - Arrive late at work, not enough time for other activities.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Research</h3>

<p>There has been some research on children transportation and a variety of solutions have been proposed. Two of the most outstanding solutions proposed are carpooling and a bus system. This could function for school, but it does not solve our problem completely, as that would work only for half od the day. </p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Past and Current Situation</h3>

<p>In the past, it was common to send children in the school bus or through public transportation. Parents could rely on the safety of the streets for their children to arrive safely to school or their other activites. With the current problem of insecurity in Mexico, sending off your children to school by hiself is just not safe anymore. There has to be a trustworthy adult accompanying the kid to his destination. This takes time from that adult in his way with the children and when he picks him up.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h3>

<p>Example #1: John has to go to school every weekday at 7am. Both his parents go to work at 8am, and they must risk getting late in order to take their kid to school. One day on their way to school, there is a car accident and they make 30 more minutes to get to school. That day, the father arrives 30 minutes late to work. </p>
<p>Example #2: Freddy has soccer practice two days a week from 4pm to 6pm. His mother takes him to practice, but has to stay somewhere near the soccer practice, as she does not have enough time to go back home and then come back to pick up Freddy. Therefore, Freddy's mother wastes 2 hours per day twice a week.</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Social Impact</h3>

<p>Driving a car with a single kid is a waste of resources and a cause for traffic. If we would drive an average of 3 kids per adult in a car, we would reduce traffic and contamination by a third compared to a single mother/father driving a single kid.</p>
<p>Having someone to drive your kids instead of you would give you more time to do more productive things, therefore people could be more focused on their work and have a better performance. </p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experts</h3>

<p>I could reach out for help with my old school's director. They were planning on implementing a bus system for the students all around the city, picking them up at meeting points.</p>
<p>I could also reach out for help to UBER, to try to implement a service of pickup for children only.</p>
<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Many times in family reunions people have been talking about the problems that traffic and driving their children everywhere cause. They say that there should be a solution by now to this problem, and I'm set to solve it.</p>
